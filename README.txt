This project parses through the complete dblp dataset, and imports the data into MongoDB. Parser was written in Python and uses xml.sax for parsing the xml file. Once data is imported into MongoDB, Spark application written in Scala is used to make changes to the database and ask queries. This project was one of the many assignments I worked on while taking Data Intensive Computing Systems class.
